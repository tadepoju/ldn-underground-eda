### What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a step in the Data Analysis Process, 
where a number of techniques are used to better understand a given dataset.

This involves but is not limited to:

* Identifying any outliers or missing values
* Identifying and extracting important variables
* Understanding the relationship(s) between variables
* Providing valuable insights relating to the data

### My Project
In this notebook the data I used relates to London Undergound 
exit data (exit.csv) to summarise the key characteristics of the dataset 
and to evaluate any patterns and / or a relationship between Morning and Evening travel peak periods.
